# To-do list
Below I list further steps to complete the project:

**Must:**
- writing a fully functional GUI
  - implementing a result view with a table
- implementing an additional event-handler for calculating the average of all grades

**Maybe:**
- changing the JavaFX components to FXML
  - using FXML to add further styling for all components
- adding support for custom grade scales
- adding support for downloading the calculated results
